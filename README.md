Hello!

This reository was created to make it easier to transfer my code (Mac OSX C++) to thebennybox (BennyQBD).

Mac OSX Build Instructions:

Once the files are downloaded, simply navigate into the fisrt 'test' folder and execute the test.xcodeproj
If you have xcode 4 installed (If not install xcode 4, from the mac app store!) 
this will launch the application with the current C++ project.
After you have completed that simply click the large play button to build and launch.
