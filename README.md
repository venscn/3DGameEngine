3DGameEngineSeries
==================


Hello!

This reository was created to make it easier to transfer my code (Mac OSX C++) to thebennybox (BennyQBD).

Mac OSX Build Instructions:

Once the files are downloaded, simply navigate into the fisrt 'test' folder and execute the test.xcodeproj
If you have xcode 5.1 installed (If not install xcode 5.1, from the mac app store!) 
this will launch the application with the current C++ project.
After you have completed that simply click the large play button to build and launch. The game should crash, if so then in finder navigate to:
/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/3DGameEnge-[A load of random characters]/Build/Products/[Debug or Release]/

Then copy the files inside the Debug folder (The one that came in the zip you downloaded!) into the other Debug or Release folder (The one that took 5 minutes to get to! :P). Now just build and run the app again and this time you should launch!
